package com.mdspicesmicro.userprofileservice.service;

/*
 *  
 *  - The purpose of this package is to serve as a container for any service classes and/ or interfaces that get created
 *  
 *   throughout the course of this project. Together, these classes will make up the interface for the entirety of the
 *   
 *    model for this project. Each of these service classes will almost certainly have an accompanying interface, which
 *    
 *    would have been used to create said class. This way, no required functionality is lost to accidental deletion, etc.,
 *    
 *    during future updates. NOTE: Services starting with the word "get" are solely for running queries.
